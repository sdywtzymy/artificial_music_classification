This project is for ECE544 (2018 Fall) course in UIUC.

## Dependencies
* Librosa
* Keras, with version >= 2.0
* Tensorflow, with version >= 1.4

Notice: this project uses Keras with Tensorflow backend. Though we try to set parameters' dimensions to fit both two backends, you may meet errors if you are using Theano as backend.

## Prerequisites
If you want to run files in '/trainer', you need [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com)
